   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Python utilities for working with `Redis <http://redis.io>`_:

* container classes
* autocomplete
* cache
* graph store
* rate limiting
* active-record models (secondary indexes, full-text search)
* locks
* more? more!

My hope is that walrus saves you time developing your application by providing
useful Redis-specific components. If you have an idea for a new feature, please
don't hesitate to `tell me about it <https://github.com/coleifer/walrus/issues/new>`_.
